daily_operations_view_update.py

Description:
    File that is used to instantiate the daily_operations_view_update DAG. This DAG runs four SQL store-procedures
    concurrently, similar to a task a Data Engineer, Analyst, or Scientist may have to run daily at the beginning of
    each work day if there weren't to have a tool like Airflow.
